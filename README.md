# Flight of a space probe simulates a probes movement from one location in the solar system to another.  
The simulation includes gravity effects of the planets.  
After requesting the starting and ending coordinates the spaceprobe will calculate the necessary heading.
The probe has a constant force engine and can point itself in the appropriate direction to travel in the direction of the necessary heading.
